# Pomodoro Timer
## Batch file driven by Visual Basic Script that runs a pomodoro timer to organise productivity

Download:
1. Check your environment variables by searching "Edit the system Environment Variables" on your computer
    1. Download pomodoro.bat, pomodoro.vbs and popup.vbs and place them in a directory listed under PATH in your environment variables
    2. Alternatively, add a new directory to your PATH variable and place them in there
2. That's it! Nice and easy

Usage:
1. Win+R (run)
2. Enter "pomodoro.vbs" _[working time] [break time] [loops]_

Now you'll get a popup notification telling you when to start working, and when your break is! Slice up your work day into manageable chunks!
